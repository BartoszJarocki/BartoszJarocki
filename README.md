### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bartosz. I'm a full stack engineer, and I have successfully taken multiple products from 0 to 1. I lead teams effectively, ensuring an environment where people can do their best work. Nowadays I mostly work with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and GraphQL. I have over 8 years of experience working remotely with companies all around the world.

I created products like [consultly.com](https://consultly.com), [monito.dev](https://monito.dev), and more. You can learn more about me by visiting [my personal website](https://jarocki.me).

I'm currently looking for new opportunities. If you'd like to work with me, [write me an email](mailto:bartosz.jarocki@hey.com).
